# UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This script is intended to help users like me who had to figure out how to write this in JavaScript.

I have the base code working, including authorization and api calls. I am still working on building the urls object for easily switching between various API enpoints. This is an unfinished product and should be used at your own risk.

I am still exploring the ServiceTitan workflow and making changes as I go along.

I hope this will help you on your endeavours.

Here are a few steps to help you get started.

1. Request API access by emailing ServiceTitan. Just google it.
2. Login and create an App in ServiceTitan. This will provide you with an app ID and tenant ID.
3. Go to your integrations panel and add the app integration. This will provide you with a client ID and client secret.
4. Plug in all of those values into the code.
